## Overview

Hybrid Retrieval and Ranking Engine is designed for high-quality search over large datasets by combining:

- Sparse lexical retrieval (BM25 on SolrCloud)
- Dense semantic retrieval (PostgreSQL + pgvector HNSW)
- Application-layer hybrid ranking and fusion
- Distributed microservice execution with gateway, caching, orchestration, and monitoring

The platform supports 500K+ documents and targets p95 end-to-end hybrid latency under 200ms in the defined benchmark envelope.

## What This System Delivers

- Hybrid lexical + semantic retrieval for stronger precision and recall
- Faceted and metadata-aware query handling
- Real-time ingestion and indexing pipeline via Kafka
- Query-time hybrid fusion and ranking controls
- Redis caching for hot-query acceleration
- REST and gRPC interfaces for service and client integration
- Kubernetes-native deployment model with health checks, scaling, and stateful infrastructure
- Full observability with Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, and alerting rules

## Architecture

![Hybrid System Architecture](design_diagrams/Hybrid.jpg)

The runtime is split into retrieval, ranking, and platform layers:

- Retrieval layer: query service, SolrCloud, vector service, PostgreSQL + pgvector, Ollama embeddings
- Ranking layer: ranking and fusion services for score normalization and final ordering
- Platform layer: gateway, orchestration, aggregation, caching, monitoring, and metadata services

Stateful infrastructure is deployed with Kubernetes primitives and service-level routing.

## Layered Architecture

The system is organized as explicit runtime layers so responsibilities are clear and independently scalable:

- Edge layer: `gateway-service` for client entry, routing, and fallback handling
- API and orchestration layer: `query-service` and `orchestration-service` for request fan-out and control-plane workflows
- Retrieval and ranking layer: `indexing-service`, `vector-service`, `fusion-service`, `ranking-service`, and `aggregation-service`
- Data and platform layer: SolrCloud, PostgreSQL + pgvector, Redis, Kafka, and ZooKeeper
- Observability layer: `monitoring-service` with Prometheus/Grafana assets under `observability/`

Within each service, code follows a consistent internal boundary:

- `controller` -> `service` -> `repository` or client adapters -> `model`

## Coordination and Cluster Management

Coordination responsibilities in this architecture:

- `ZooKeeper` coordinates SolrCloud cluster state, node membership, and collection/config metadata.
- `ZooKeeper` is also used by Kafka in the current deployment mode for broker metadata coordination.
- `Kubernetes` orchestrates service deployments, networking, health probes, scaling policies, and stateful runtime primitives.

Operationally, this means retrieval/index services rely on Kubernetes for workload orchestration, while SolrCloud/Kafka coordination flows through ZooKeeper where required by the current stack.

## Services

Core services in the platform:

- `ingestion-service`: accepts and validates incoming documents
- `indexing-service`: consumes ingestion events and updates retrieval indexes
- `query-service`: executes hybrid fan-out and returns unified search responses
- `vector-service`: embedding + vector retrieval over pgvector
- `ranking-service`: ranking feature extraction and ranking strategy execution
- `fusion-service`: lexical/semantic score normalization and fusion
- `aggregation-service`: multi-source result aggregation and shaping
- `caching-service`: Redis-backed query/result caching
- `metadata-service`: metadata persistence and lookup
- `gateway-service`: edge routing, retries, auth enforcement, and fallback behavior
- `monitoring-service`: metrics exposure and runtime health signal surface
- `orchestration-service`: pipeline coordination and scheduled workflows
- `frontend-service`: Next.js search UI with lexical/semantic/hybrid score-mode toggle

## Data and Query Flow

Ingestion flow:

1. Client sends document payload to ingestion service.
2. Ingestion service publishes events to Kafka.
3. Indexing service consumes events and updates Solr and metadata/vector stores.

Query flow:

1. Client sends search request to gateway/query path.
2. Query service executes parallel lexical and semantic retrieval.
3. Query service merges lexical and semantic signals into final ranked top-k response.
4. Redis-backed cache is populated/checked for repeated query acceleration via `caching-service`.
5. Query and stage metrics are emitted for observability.

## APIs

### REST

- `POST /search` - hybrid search request
- `GET /facets` - facet and filter metadata retrieval
- `GET /actuator/health` - service health checks
- Domain APIs for ingestion, ranking, fusion, metadata, and orchestration operations

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"wireless headphones","topK":20}'
```

### gRPC

gRPC contracts are available for high-throughput service-to-service and external client integration where low-latency binary transport is preferred.

- Query gRPC server: `localhost:9093` (`HybridQueryService`)
- Vector gRPC server: `localhost:9094` (`VectorSearchService`)
- Quick smoke test:

```bash
./scripting/grpc-smoke.sh
```

- Dockerized smoke test (no host `grpcurl` required):

```bash
./scripting/grpc-smoke-docker.sh
```

Direct examples:

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext \
  -import-path query-service/src/main/proto \
  -proto hybrid_query.proto \
  -d '{"query":"content:hybrid","top_k":5}' \
  localhost:9093 HybridQueryService/HybridSearch
```

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext \
  -import-path vector-service/src/main/proto \
  -proto vector_search.proto \
  -d '{"query":"hybrid search","top_k":3}' \
  localhost:9094 VectorSearchService/Search
```

## Storage Layer

- SolrCloud: distributed BM25 index, faceting, and structured filter execution
- PostgreSQL + pgvector HNSW: semantic vectors and ANN nearest-neighbor retrieval using `vector_cosine_ops`
- Redis: low-latency cache for repeated hybrid query results
- Metadata persistence: document metadata, vector linkage, and query logging

Representative schema entities:

- `documents`
- `vector_metadata`
- `query_logs`

## Observability and SLOs

Observability assets included:

- Prometheus scrape config: `observability/prometheus/prometheus.yml`
- Alert rules: `observability/alerts/hybrid-alert-rules.yml`
- Grafana datasource provisioning: `observability/grafana/datasources/prometheus-datasource.yaml`
- Grafana dashboard provisioning: `observability/grafana/dashboards/dashboards.yaml`
- Dashboard JSON: `observability/grafana/dashboards/hybrid-overview.json`

Key runtime metrics:

- `hybrid_query_count_total`
- `solr_query_latency_ms`
- `vector_query_latency_ms`
- `ranking_merge_duration_ms`
- `cache_hit_count_total`
- `cache_miss_count_total`

Primary service objectives:

- Hybrid search p95 latency under 200ms
- Error rate under 1%
- Stable cache hit ratio under sustained mixed-query load

## Performance Profile

Benchmark definitions used in this project:

- `cold run`: the first benchmark pass after service restart or fresh validation run; caches are not pre-warmed.
- `warm run`: the immediate second benchmark pass with the same setup; caches/JIT/routes are already warmed.
- `p95 latency`: 95th percentile end-to-end request latency; 95% of requests complete at or below this time.
- `SLO pass`: `p95 < 200ms` and error rate `< 1%` for the benchmark pass.

Target benchmark profile:

- Dataset target: 500,000+ documents
- Query mix: lexical+semantic hybrid dominant
- Concurrency: 20 virtual users
- Sustained load: 10-15 QPS
- Result size: top-k = 20
- SLO: p95 hybrid latency < 200ms

Validation workflow (for 500K target):

```bash
TARGET_DOCS=500000 CONCURRENCY=40 BENCH_REQUESTS=100 BENCH_CONCURRENCY=20 BENCH_RATE_QPS=12 ./scripting/validate-500k-e2e.sh
```

Preset dataset runners:

```bash
./scripting/run_5k_doc_engine.sh
./scripting/run_25k_doc_engine.sh
./scripting/run_50k_doc_engine.sh
./scripting/run_100k_doc_engine.sh
./scripting/run_250k_doc_engine.sh
./scripting/run_500k_doc_engine.sh
```

Paced validator smoke (quick end-to-end dry run of the same flow):

```bash
make validate-500k-paced-smoke
```

Latency budget model:

- Embedding generation: <= 60ms
- Solr retrieval: <= 50ms
- pgvector HNSW retrieval: <= 50ms
- Fusion/ranking/serialization: <= 40ms

## Latency Optimization

To keep hybrid search within latency SLO, the query path uses timeout guards and caching:

- Query-service sets strict downstream timeouts for Solr and vector calls:
  - `solr.request-timeout-ms`
  - `vector.request-timeout-ms`
  - `vector.grpc.timeout-ms`
- Vector-service caches embeddings to avoid repeated Ollama calls for hot queries:
  - `vector.embedding-cache.enabled`
  - `vector.embedding-cache.ttl-seconds`
  - `vector.embedding-cache.max-entries`
- Query-service caches full hybrid responses for repeated `(query, topK)` requests:
  - `query.cache.enabled`
  - `query.cache.ttl-seconds`
  - `query.cache.max-entries`

- Ollama requires a warm-up call after the vector container starts so the embeddings model loads before benchmarks. Run this inside the compose network before hitting `/search`:

  ```bash
  docker run --rm --network hybrid-retrieval-and-ranking-engine_default \
    curlimages/curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{time_total}\n" \
    "http://vector-service:8084/api/vector/search?query=warm+up&topK=1"
  ```

  The call completes in a few seconds on a cold start, and after that the semantic stage responds in ~0.2‑0.7 s; repeat the warm-up only after Ollama/vector rebuilds or restarts.

- The runtime budgets currently allocate `query.execution.total-budget-ms=3000` with a `vector-stage-budget-ms=2500`, giving the lexical stage ~500 ms while the vector stage can run near 2.5 s before the hybrid guard kicks in.
- Vector timeouts are now `vector.request-timeout-ms=4000` and `vector.grpc.timeout-ms=4000` so both REST and gRPC have the same 4 s window to call the warmed Ollama + HNSW pipeline.

This design prioritizes fast, stable responses under load and degrades gracefully if semantic retrieval is slow.

Recent in-network benchmark snapshot:

- `total_requests: 100`
- `error_rate_pct: 0.000`
- `avg_latency_ms: 14.120`
- `p95_latency_ms: 22.658`

```

Paced SLO benchmark pair (README envelope at 12 QPS):

```bash
make benchmark-slo
```

CI-style quick benchmark gate (fast paced smoke):

```bash

```

Default smoke profile:

- requests: `40`
- concurrency: `5`
- paced rate: `8 QPS`

## Local Deployment

Prerequisites:

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.9+
- Docker + Docker Compose

- Airflow expects a 32-byte URL-safe Base64 value in `AIRFLOW__CORE__FERNET_KEY` for secret encryption. Generate one locally using the `python3 - <<'PY'` command shown in `Walkthroughs/FERNET_KEY_ROTATION.md`, stash it in `.env.local`, and never commit the file.

Build and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arup-Chauhan/Hybrid-Retrieval-and-Ranking-Engine.git
cd Hybrid-Retrieval-and-Ranking-Engine
mvn clean package
docker-compose -p hybrid-retrieval-and-ranking-engine up --build -d
```

Or use the project Make target (build + compose up in one step):

```bash
make up
```

Quick walkthrough:

- `docs/demo.md`

Frontend UI:

- URL: `http://localhost:3001` (single-page UI with lexical / semantic / hybrid mode).
- Env override for frontend proxy upstream: `QUERY_API_BASE` (defaults to `http://query-service:8083`).
- The Next.js server exposes `/api/search` as a same-origin proxy so browsers call `localhost:3001` and the proxy routes into the Compose network (no direct host port access required).
- Sample FIFA queries for verification:
  - `recommendations for immersive multiplayer racing experiences`
  - `Who won the World Cup in 1994?`
  - `Brazil penalty shootout final 1994`
    Toggle the mode dropdown (hybrid/lexical/semantic) to see how each signal contributes to the score.
- Optional component: backend services and curl-based search workflows run unchanged without `frontend-service`.

Stop local stack:

```bash
docker-compose -p hybrid-retrieval-and-ranking-engine down
```

## Kubernetes Deployment

Kubernetes manifests are provided under `k8s/` for:

- SolrCloud and coordination services
- PostgreSQL + pgvector init
- Ollama and model bootstrap
- Redis
- Application service deployments and services
- Monitoring components

Deploy:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

## Batch and Refresh Workflows

Batch and refresh workflows are implemented with Apache Airflow in this repository.

Current state:

- Online path is implemented in service runtime (`ingestion-service`, `indexing-service`, `query-service`).
- 500K validation and benchmark automation is provided via scripts under `scripting/`.
- Airflow DAGs live under `airflow/dags/`.

Airflow stack (local, Docker Compose):

```bash
docker-compose -p hybrid-retrieval-and-ranking-engine up -d airflow-db airflow-init airflow-webserver airflow-scheduler
```

Access Airflow UI:

- URL: `http://localhost:8088`
- default credentials: `admin` / `admin`

Bundled DAG:

- `hybrid_control_plane_dag`
  - schedule: every 6 hours
  - tasks:
    - trigger orchestration flow (`POST /orchestrate/trigger`)
    - ingestion probe (`POST /api/ingest`)
    - query probe (`POST /search`)

## Custom Search Base

Use this when you want domain-specific data (for example Hot Wheels, FIFA 26, or any website corpus) instead of synthetic load.

Step 1: scrape site pages into a dataset file (JSONL recommended):

```bash
python3 ./scripting/web_dataset_scraper.py \
  --start-url "https://example.com" \
  --depth 2 \
  --max-pages 500 \
  --format jsonl \
  --output ./data/custom-domain.jsonl
```

Step 2: ingest the generated file into `ingestion-service`:

```bash
INPUT_PATH=./data/custom-domain.jsonl \
INPUT_FORMAT=jsonl \
INGEST_URL=http://localhost:18081/api/ingest \
CONCURRENCY=20 \
./scripting/load-ingestion-file.sh
```

Step 3: query the indexed custom dataset:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:18083/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"custom keyword","topK":10}'
```

Protocol note:

- Ingestion path currently uses REST (`POST /api/ingest`).
- gRPC in this repository is for query/vector contracts, not ingestion.
